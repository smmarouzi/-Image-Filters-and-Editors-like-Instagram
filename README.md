# Image-Filters-and-Editors-like-Instagram
In this project I have developed the C++ codes for Image Filtering and Editing like what we have in Instagram application.

There are the basic editor classes which you can create most of the Instagram filters based on their values.

- The basic classes are Hue-Rotate, Sepia, Brightness, Contrast and Saturation.
- The filters consist of Juno, Ludwig, XproII and Hudson,...
- The values for creating the filters is taken from https://github.com/picturepan2/instagram.css/tree/master/src
- I have tried to access the same range and values for my basic classes to create those filters

- Include consists of all header files.
- Src consists of all source files. 

The whole classes get the input and output path and have one or two parametes to set. The range of the parameters is provided in header files.

You can test the all filters and see the results by runing the main function in GloFilters.
